## Lo-fi Solution for the Adding Problem for RNNs

This is a solution to the adding problem for sequences where two
elements out of a sequence of random float values must be learned
to be correctly summed up by a model (RNN, LSTM, ...)

### Installation (optional)
With your venv activated, navigate to the solution directory and then run
```
pip install -e .
```

### Run

The models can be created and the results inspected using the notebook
```sequence_addition.ipynb```.
