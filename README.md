## ML Challenges
Some solutions to ML and data science challenges

These solutions are not meant to squeeze out the last bit of accuracy to get a place mear the top on a
leaderboard. Instead they provide some exploratory data analysis which leads to compact ML models.
They might be of interest as a starting point for your own experiments.
